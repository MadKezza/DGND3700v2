NOTES

There is a lot of chicken and egg stuff here ...

 - Top level Rule.mak needs to auto set the directory it is in.

 - I suspect that the building of packages and extra_binaries relies on
   some makefile rules which are only in place after the Netgear stuff
   has been made once. Not sure how much they need.

 - Port forwarding has been modded so that a sdestination start port
   is added to the internal storage array. Actually doing this results
   in the forward not happening. We need to break into the 
   'turn on portforarding' rc, but not quite clear where that is.

 - Ad-blocking started work: a block list is downloaded, but somehow is being ignored.
