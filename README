NOTES

There is a lot of chicken and egg stuff here ...

 - Top level Rule.mak needs things set better in it.

 - I suspect that the building of packages and extra_binaries relies on
   some makefile rules which are only in place after the Netgear stuff
   has been made once. Not sure how much they need.

 - rootweb requires the original target.tar.bz2 from Netgear in it as
   target-orig.tar.bz2. You can't simplty 'use the original' because we
   replace the original as part of building things in order to
   delude the netgear 'make source' to include our alterations.

 - rootweb/original is only there for reference.

 - Port forwarding has been modded so that a sdestination start port
   is added to the internal storage array. No idea yet if that is enough
   to trigger the right behaviour. If not, we need to break into the 
   'turn on portforarding' rc, but not quite clear where that is. However ...

 - The DNS start trigger may be a good point to correct port forwarding if
   it turns out to be needed.
   
 - Ad-blocking started work: a block list is downloaded, but somehow is being ignored.
