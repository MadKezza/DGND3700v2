One file per .html file in the parent directory which you wish to take
control of. The file in this directory defines for each render variable
in the .htm (which have the format @variable#) what is the internal
variable stored in nvram and the relationship between the values they
use. Format of the file is one line per variable pair:

@page_render_variable# nvram_variable relationship

Replace nvram with 'UNDEFINED' if there is no value stored in nvram for
that render variable. Why would this be? Search me, but it seems to
happen.

relationship:

 - 'text' simply copy the contents across.

 - 'opts:pval1=nval1;pval2=nval2...' there is an option list for which
    the page value 'pvalX' should be used for the nvram value 'nvalX'.


The following render variables should not be listed as they are automatically determined
for every page:
@model_name#
@post_par#
@SID#

Some examples

sysDNSProvider dns_provider text
pvc_list       UNDEFINED    text
sysDNSActive   dns_enable   opts:enable=1;disable=0
